A compiler is a program that translates high-level programming code into machine code, enabling a computer to execute the instructions. The major components of a compiler are:
1. Lexical Analyzer (Lexical Analysis)

    Function: Breaks the source code into tokens (small meaningful chunks, like keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).
    Output: Tokens.
    Tools Used: Regular expressions, finite automata.
    Errors Handled: Lexical errors (e.g., invalid characters in the source code).

2. Syntax Analyzer (Parsing)

    Function: Checks the sequence of tokens for grammatical correctness based on a formal grammar.
    Output: Parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST).
    Tools Used: Context-free grammar, parsers (LL, LR, SLR, LALR, etc.).
    Errors Handled: Syntax errors (e.g., missing semicolons or mismatched parentheses).

3. Semantic Analyzer (Semantic Analysis)

    Function: Ensures the program's meaning is valid (e.g., type checking, variable declarations).
    Output: Annotated syntax tree or AST with semantic information.
    Tools Used: Symbol tables, type-checking rules.
    Errors Handled: Semantic errors (e.g., type mismatches or undeclared variables).

4. Intermediate Code Generator

    Function: Transforms the AST into an intermediate representation (IR) that is easier to optimize and translate into machine code.
    Output: Intermediate Code (e.g., Three-Address Code, Quadruples, Abstract Stack Machine Code).
    Tools Used: Compiler-specific IR formats.
    Errors Handled: None, but issues in code generation may indicate earlier stage problems.

5. Code Optimizer

    Function: Improves the IR for better performance (e.g., reducing execution time or memory usage).
    Techniques: Dead code elimination, loop unrolling, common subexpression elimination, etc.
    Output: Optimized Intermediate Code.

6. Code Generator

    Function: Converts the optimized IR into target machine code (assembly or binary).
    Output: Machine code or assembly code.
    Tools Used: Register allocation, instruction selection.
    Errors Handled: None directly, but bugs in code generation may result in incorrect output.

7. Error Handling and Reporting

    Function: Detects, reports, and sometimes recovers from errors in all compiler stages.
    Errors Handled:
        Lexical errors.
        Syntax errors.
        Semantic errors.
        Runtime errors (partly during code generation).

8. Symbol Table Manager

    Function: Maintains a table of all symbols (variables, functions, etc.) in the code with information like scope, type, and memory location.
    Used By: Lexical analyzer, semantic analyzer, intermediate code generator, and code generator.

9. Runtime Environment (Optional)

    Function: Supports runtime features like memory management, garbage collection, and dynamic linking.
